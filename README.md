# fmri-simulations (wip)
This is a collection of scripts used to analyze fMRI data from Horikawa & Kamitani (2017), available on [openneuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001246/versions/1.2.1).

Based on the results of the analyses, synthetic data with known noise structure will be simulated.

The simulations are then used to test the quality of statistical inference of RSA 3.0, implemented in [pyrsa](https://github.com/rsagroup/pyrsa).
