# fmri-simulations (wip)
This is a collection of scripts used to analyze fMRI data from openneuro [repository] (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001246/versions/1.2.1).

Based on the results, synthetic data with known noise structure will be simulated.

The simulations are used to test the quality of statistical inference of RSA 3.0, implemented in pyrsa [repository](https://github.com/rsagroup/pyrsa).
