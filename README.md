# fMRI Simulations for Testing RSA 
This is a collection of scripts used to analyze fMRI data from Horikawa & Kamitani (2017), available on [openneuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001246/versions/1.2.1). Based on the results of the analyses, synthetic data with known noise structure are simulated and used to test statistical inference of RSA 3.0, implemented in [pyrsa](https://github.com/rsagroup/pyrsa).
